# Configure Your Project

One of the foundational ideas of Protocode is to automate the setup of projects, so that this time is spent only once, rather than repeating it every time a new developer joins or when a machine is replaced.

To achieve this, you have interfaces that guide you step by step in configuring your project, from receiving the source code to virtualization, as well as integrating initialization scripts.
