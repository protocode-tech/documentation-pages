When the environment is open, a "Preview" menu is available, allowing you to access all the URLs of the project.  

![preview](preview.png?style=max-width:25rem;)  

Click on the "app" link, and a new tab will open with the rendered version of your application.  
To the right of each link, you will find a "Persistent Link" button, which provides a public URL that automatically reopens the environment if it is closed or paused. This allows you to share a URL with a tester, enabling them to view the rendered version at their convenience, without requiring registration.
