title: 'Save your work'
---

When working in an environment and you want to save your progress, you have two options:

* **Pause the environment**: In other words, save the current state of the environment and stop consuming cloud resources. It can be restarted later, and you'll pick up where you left off.  
* **Commit and push your changes**: Just like locally, you can create a Git branch, commit your changes, and push them to your remote repository. Once this is done, you can close the environment permanently or reuse it to work on something else.
