You can add as many people as you want to your workspace. Once added, these people can be integrated into your projects. To add people, simply click on "Members" in the sidebar menu, then click the "Invite" button.

When you click the button, a modal will open and prompt you to fill in some basic information, including the person's first name, last name, and email address. You will then need to choose a profile, which corresponds to a set of permissions. Here’s a summary:

| Profile | Modify workspace | View members | Invite/modify/delete members | Create projects | Manage all projects | Details |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| **Administrator** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | This is the highest profile with all rights, including managing subscriptions and payment methods. |
| **Manager** | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | This profile has the maximum rights to manage projects, whether or not they are a member of the project. |
| **Developer** | No | Yes | No | No | No | This profile grants intermediate rights allowing the user to see the members of the workspace and the projects they belong to. |
| **Guest** | No | No | No | No | No | This is the lowest profile, which only allows the user to see the projects they are attached to. |

!!! These rights are freely customizable. For example, if you want to grant a developer intermediate rights allowing them to create members or view all projects, simply check the corresponding rights during the invitation creation or afterward.

After submitting the invitation, the user will receive an email containing a link that will redirect them to a page inviting them to either create a new account or use an existing one. What happens next depends on the situation:

* **If they don't have an account** (the invitation hasn't created one), they will need to go through the account creation step. They will then be attached to the inviting workspace.
* **If they already have an account**, because they’ve already created a workspace or have been invited to one, they can reuse their existing account. Once logged in, they can switch between workspaces.

!!! The status of the invitation is visible in the list of members in your workspace. Even if it is still "Pending", you can add the newly added member to a project and assign tasks to them. These tasks will be linked to the member once they accept the invitation and will appear in their "My Tasks" section.
