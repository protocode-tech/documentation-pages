When you visit the preview URL of an environment, the server may return a 503 error like this:

![error_503](error_503.png?style=max-width:35rem;)

## Why this error?

It is likely that the link you are accessing is no longer valid and the environment has been paused or stopped.

## How to resolve the issue?

1. **Check the environment status**  
   - Go back to the Protocode interface.
   - Go to the task where the environment was opened.
   - Check if the environment is still active.
   - If necessary, restart it.

2. **Obtain a valid link**  
   - Once the environment has been restarted, click the **"Preview"** menu to get a new valid link.
