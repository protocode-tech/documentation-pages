* **User Account and Subscription**: Protocode services require the prior creation of a user account and a [subscription plan](/plans-and-billing/subscription-plans).  
* **Versioned Source Code**: To configure a project, it must have versioned source code on [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). Of course, you must also have sufficient rights (read and write) on the project to be configured.  
* **Knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose**: These are the two core technologies on which our services are based. While we have significantly simplified the configuration process (especially with [AI-assisted configuration](/project-configuration/ai-assisted-configuration)), having some basic knowledge remains useful.  
* **Compatible IDE**: Our solution can only be used with IDEs capable of connecting via SSH, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), or one of the [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/ides/).  
* **Stable Internet Connection**: Our solution hosts development environments in the cloud. Without an Internet connection, it is not possible to access them.
