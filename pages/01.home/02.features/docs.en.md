## Collaborative Project Management  

Protocode allows you to organize your teams, assign tasks, and track their progress in a centralized manner.  

## Flexible Development Interfaces  

Each assigned task enables the developer to launch **a preconfigured work environment with a single click**. This environment is hosted in the cloud, allowing work to be carried out either from a [web interface](/connect-and-customize/web-interfaces) (_a portable version of Visual Studio Code_), with [Visual Studio Code](/connect-and-customize/visual-studio-code) installed on their machine, or with [JetBrains IDEs](/connect-and-customize/jetbrains-ides).  

## Cloud Development Environments  

Each developer has **a specific environment for each task they are responsible for** (whether within the same project or different projects), which they can **quickly connect to**. This allows them to switch between tasks without reconfiguring their workstation or to rapidly address an issue by creating a dedicated environment for the task at hand.  

## Real-Time Preview  

Based on the configured settings (see the [Virtualization](/project-configuration/containers-routing) section), each environment provides **preview URLs**, accessible for each task to functionally test the code produced by a developer. This means that all work can be **instantly tested without deployment** by anyone overseeing the project.  

Once the work is validated, all that's left is to push the changes and close the environment.
