Using Protocode requires a subscription. The only exception is for "On-Premise" versions, which are installed on a client's personal cloud infrastructure and are subject to a specific license.

## Subscription Types

We offer a free "Starter" plan, which provides 50 free credits per month with no possibility of exceeding the allocated quota.

Additionally, we offer two paid plans with a higher volume of credits for more intensive use, allowing for overage charges.

!!! For more details on our subscription plans, please visit our [pricing page](https://protocode.tech/en/pricing).

## Commitment

Some plans may offer a 12-month commitment in exchange for a discounted rate. This commitment will lock the interface, preventing any changes to the plan or cancellation until the anniversary date. After this date, your plan will switch to a non-committed plan, allowing you to change plans, re-commit (for another discount), or cancel at your discretion.

!!! Whether committed or not, the "Flex" option included in business plans, which allows companies to adjust the number of subscribed licenses on a monthly basis, is never locked.

## Trial Period

For plans that include a trial period, the trial ends either when the trial period expires or when half of the allocated credits have been used.

!!! An email notification is sent when 45% of the credits are used during the trial period.

## Billing Cycle

The subscription date marks the beginning of the billing cycle, which lasts one month.  
For example, if a subscription starts on February 15 at 00:00, the billing period will end on March 14 at 23:59.

Only at the end of the billing period are the consumed and potentially over-consumed credits accounted for. An invoice is then issued and made available in the "Billing" section of the interface, with a payment request sent to your bank shortly thereafter.
