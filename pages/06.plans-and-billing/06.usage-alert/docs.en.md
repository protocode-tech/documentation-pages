At Protocode, we send notifications to alert our customers of significant consumption to avoid any unpleasant surprises.

## During the Trial Period

Some plans offer a trial period, which ends either after a certain number of days (typically 14 days) or when **half of the credits** in the plan have been used.

We send an email notification when you have consumed **45%** of the credits in your plan, to warn the user and remind them of the terms of the trial period.

## In Other Cases

For all paid plans, a notification is sent **when 85% of the allocated credits** have been consumed in the selected plan.

## Notification Recipients

The email address used for sending notifications is the one entered in "Billing" > "Billing Information". Make sure to provide a valid email address that is regularly checked to receive these alerts.
