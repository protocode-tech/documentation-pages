You can modify or cancel your subscription directly within the Protocode interface. To do so, go to "Billing" and click on the contextual menu of the "Subscription" section.

## Modifying a Subscription

Upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan takes effect immediately.

However, **modifying a paid subscription to another paid plan will only take effect at the end of the current billing period**. You can cancel this modification at any time before the billing period ends.

## Cancelling a Subscription

Subscription cancellations follow the same principle. **The cancellation only takes effect at the end of the current billing period**, and you can revoke it at any time before the billing period ends.
