In the "Code" context menu of an assignment, you are given the option to "Connect via SSH". This option opens a modal where you will find a command line to copy, allowing you to connect via SSH from your terminal, like this:

[prism classes="language-bash"]
ssh protocode@e1.xxx.protocode.cloud -p 2222
[/prism]

Simply copy the command and paste it into your terminal.
