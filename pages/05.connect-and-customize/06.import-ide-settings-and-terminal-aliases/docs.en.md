`FEATURE IN BÃŠTA`

To allow you to continue working without changing your habits, we have developed an extension for Visual Studio Code called [Protocode Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Protocode.protocode-vscode-extension). This extension enables you to retrieve your local themes, preferences, keyboard shortcuts, and terminal aliases and synchronize them with the environments opened on Protocode.

## **Installation and Usage**

Once the extension is installed, it adds an entry called "Protocode Sync" in the left sidebar of VSCode. Clicking on it will prompt you to authenticate.

After authentication, the extension automatically synchronizes your themes, preferences, keyboard shortcuts, and terminal aliases.
